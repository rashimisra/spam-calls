        <p>As per <a href = "https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-409412A1.pdf"> Federal Communications Commission (FCC) </a>, on an average U.S. consumer receives 13 spam or fraud calls per month. These illegal calls are not just annoying and disruptive; they also cause consumers to lose significant amounts of money. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reports a median loss of $1,480 for fraud by phone call, or $850 million total each year.</p> 

        <p>Unwanted calls continue to be the FCC's most common complaint in 2024, with Americans reporting over 95,000 such calls in 2023. Data analysis shows these nuisance calls predominantly occur during morning and early afternoon hours. The Federal Trade Commission reports the number of complaints in 2023 marked a five-year low.</p>

        <p>The largest portion of this funding was allocated to research activities, with medical and STEM fields receiving the highest levels of support. This doesn't include indirect benefits to universities from federal student loan programs where payments go directly to students and not the institutions</p>
        </p>
        <p>According to USA Facts, More than $6 billion is spent on the eight Ivy Leagues out of this total federal funds to the universities. These institutions form 8% of such funding and only 0.5 % of the total American universities.   
        </p>


        <p>Columbia University received about $1.3 billions of federal funds in the fiscal year 2023-24. This is the highest proportion of the  operating revenue among all the ivies. The university is highly dependent on the funds that it gets as part of patient care and net tuition fees. In March 2025, the Trump administration threatened the university with a cut of $400 million if it does not overhaul its protest policies, security practices and Middle Eastern, South Asian and African studies department. </p>

        <p>Such funds that universities receive from the federal government are often in the form of grants and used for research and development, facility and administrative costs and student aid. The administration had threatened the university on incompetency to address antisemitism on campus. Despite the university accepting the changes, it is still vulnerable to losing the amount. </p>        
        
        <p>The Trump administration paused $175 million in federal funding to the University of Pennsylvania over its inclusion of transgender athletes in womenâ€™s sports in 2022.</p>

        <p>The administration has targeted six leagues for punitive funding cuts or explicitly warned them about serious funding risks. Brown University faces a potential $510 million loss. Cornell University confronts a minimum cut of $1 billion. Princeton University indicated risk of losing $210 million</p>

        <p>Ivy leagues receive a large amount of endowments every year.</p>

        <p>The Trump administration announced in March that it was reviewing approximately $256 million in federal contracts with Harvard, along with an additional $8.7 billion in what they called "multiyear grant commitments." The administration suggested that Harvard had failed to adequately address antisemitism on campus, though they didn't provide specific details about what actions the university should take to address their concerns.<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/harvard-plans-borrow-750-million-after-federal-funding-threats-2025-04-07/">Harvard University plans to borrow $750 million</a> from Wall Street as part of contingency preparations.</p>
        
        <p>Harvard has the largest endowment of any US university, a $53 billion. All the seven ivies are among the top 20 colleges in the US which gather the largest endowments, except for the Brown University. </p>

        <p>Most of the endowments are legally tied up, donors specified exactly what it can be used for like scholarships or specific research areas.
        </p>

        <p> Federal grants pay for very specific research projects,  they cover salaries, equipment, and support for graduate students. The endowment money usually doesn't have the flexibility to replace these specialized funds.
        </p>

        </div>

        
    
            <p>While it is uncertain how much of these cuts get actualised, it is becoming clearer about how much universities could lose if Trump succeeds in limiting NIH funding, which supports most US medical research. The policy change has already triggered multiple lawsuits and is currently blocked by a federal judge. NIH is the world's largest public funder of biomedical research and covers "indirect costs" like facilities and administration, rates that vary between universities. 
            </p>

            <p>Trump wants to cap these indirect costs at just 15% of grants, potentially costing universities millions and forcing them to either cut other programs or compromise on research administration, risking accounting problems and regulatory non-compliance.
